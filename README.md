# ⚠️ DEPRECATED ⚠️
This repository is not maintained anymore. It was made based on [react-with-gesture](https://github.com/drcmda/react-with-gesture) due to a previous limitation of it.

React-spring's `react-with-gesture` now has improved a lot and was renamed to `react-use-gesture`.

Consider using this package instead: https://github.com/react-spring/react-use-gesture

### react-use-gestures
An utility function to use with React hooks that plays well with https://github.com/drcmda/react-spring.

Inspired by [react-with-gesture](https://github.com/drcmda/react-with-gesture).
